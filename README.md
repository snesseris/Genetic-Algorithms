# Genetic-Algorithms
Codes in Mathematica and Python implementing a Genetic Algorithm regression approach. For Mathematica version 11.2+ recommended.

In the Mathematica version you can:
1) Run the GA with multiple grammars, adjust the crossover and mutation rates.
2) Run in parallel to harness all the available CPUs.
3) Run with both uncorrelated and correlated data, just change the likelihood.
4) Perform error estimates using the path-integral approach, see the paper arXiv:1205.0364.

The Python version, called "GATO" = Genetic Algorithm TOolkit is now (August 2023) released!

If you use this code, please cite the papers 0903.2805, 1205.0364, 1910.01529, 2001.11420 and 2211.14142 (see the references.txt file for the bib entries).
