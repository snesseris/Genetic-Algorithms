# Genetic-Algorithms
Codes implementing a Genetic Algorithm regression approach in Mathematica. Version 11.2+ recommended.

In this version:
1) Run the GA with multiple grammars, adjust the crossover and mutation rates.
2) Fully parallelized to harness all the available CPU.
3) Can run with both uncorrelated and correlated data, just change the likelihood.
4) Error estimates using the path-integral approach.

If you use this code, please cite the papers 0903.2805, 1205.0364, 1910.01529, 2001.11420 (see the references.txt file for the bib entries).
